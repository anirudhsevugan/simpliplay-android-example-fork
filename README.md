An Android app that allows you to play video using ExoPlayer, which supports many video formats, supports subtitles, and even includes support for playlists in the AI2 releases!

## App Inventor Ver.
The App Inventor version primarily uses the [ExoPlayer for App Inventor](https://github.com/zainulhassan815/exoplayer-appinventor) extension to create ExoPlayer initializations, and is a modified version of the 1.0.4 AIA version of the [ExoPlayer for App Inventor demo](https://github.com/zainulhassan815/exoplayer-appinventor/blob/v2.0/aia/exoplayer_v1.0.4.aia).

| Android 9 | Yes  |   VM   |
| Android 8 | Yes  |   VM   |
| Android 5 | **Partially**  |   VM   |

*Android 5 does not support enough codecs, so only videos taken from the camera will play at all*.

## Flutter Ver.
The Flutter version was built in Android Studio with the Flutter plugin, and primarily relies on the video_player and chewie plugins, uses the keep_screen_on plugin to keep screen active when playing a video, uses the file_picker plugin to pick a video and subtitle file on your device to play, and unlike the App Inventor version, uses a different UI standard, which is rendered with [Skia](https://skia.org/), Material UI.

It uses **Media 3 ExoPlayer**, something the App Inventor version would've been dreaming of, but has less controls, but is simpler to use and *much* more user-friendly, and is solely ExoPlayer (at least, for now). It does not support a quality selector, or advanced audio settings, but it supports everything else the App Inventor version does in the ExoPlayer point of view (P.O.V).

## Media3 Demo (Very Early Demo)
> [!WARNING]
> This version that doesn't support media URLs or files, and serves as a demo in its purest form. This version is **no longer supported**, and will not recieve updates on further notice.

The Media3 Demo was built in Android Studio using Kotlin, and uses the [Media3 Player](https://github.com/akhorasani/Media3Player) app by [@akhorasani](https://github.com/akhorasani) as a base for all Media3 support, and uses the traditional INTENT methods for URL redirects in Kotlin.

It, unlike the other 2 versions, is in a **very early** state right now and does not support video URLs (believe me, I tried, and failed), as of now. However, the placeholder video is the [Big Buck Bunny](https://peach.blender.org/) short film, stored in a GCP (Google Cloud Protocol) storage bucket.
